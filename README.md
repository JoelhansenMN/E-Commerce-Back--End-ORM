## E-Commerce ORM project (back-end) 

## Description
  For this task we were instructed to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. We configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. We built the models with the provided requirements and developed routes in order for the site to work. The routes  (get, post, update and delete) were all tested through Postman and a video of their functionality were were included in this readme.
